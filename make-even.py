# In this Kata we are passing a number (n) into a function.

# Your code will determine if the number passed is even (or not).

# The function needs to return either a true or false.

# Numbers may be positive or negative, integers or floats.

# Floats with decimal part non equal to zero are considered UNeven for this kata.

# Python has a trick called the modulus operator (%). It tells you the remainder when you divide one number by another.

# If you do number % 2 and get 0, it means no remainder â†’ the number is even!
